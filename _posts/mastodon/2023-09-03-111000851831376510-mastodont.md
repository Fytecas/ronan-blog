<p>In April 2023 I set out to build a bookshelf. Our main room was big and almost empty. I wanted to put our books there, in the center of the house. We have a collection of bandes dessinées, both in the classic a-bit-more-than-a4 format (Asterix), and in smaller sizes (l&#39;Arabe du Futur). I also have a nice collection of never read books, which I like looking at and sometimes start without finishing them ; Giono, Stendhal Pléiade, half of the complete San Antonio collection...

<p>Christopher Schwarz did the Monticello bookcase (<a href="https://blog.lostartpress.com/2018/12/19/monticello-bookcases-complete/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">blog.lostartpress.com/2018/12/</span><span class="invisible">19/monticello-bookcases-complete/</span></a>) with a great many dovetails, and lots of wood. He also has a simple one in The Anarchist&#39;s Design Book (<a href="https://blog.lostartpress.com/2016/12/15/boarded-bookshelf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">blog.lostartpress.com/2016/12/</span><span class="invisible">15/boarded-bookshelf/</span></a>), which is not very high but shows a simple nailed construction. Paul Sellers shows a bookshelf for his Home project (<a href="https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/sellers-home-bookshelf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">woodworkingmasterclasses.com/v</span><span class="invisible">ideos/sellers-home-bookshelf/</span></a>), whose design is not my style. He also has another (<a href="https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/simple-bookshelf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">woodworkingmasterclasses.com/v</span><span class="invisible">ideos/simple-bookshelf/</span></a>), with a simple construction based on keyed tenons, which I liked. (tbc)</p>
<p>My grandfather had nothing in the bookshelves department, and anyway dovetails and keyed tenons were not his thing. (tbc)</p>
<p>So I bought some beech from Machot and got to work. On the 9th an 10th of May I glued the two sides, each from two boards. I had straightened the edges with my Veritas 62 handplane.</p>

<p>On the eleventh of May I flattened the sides with the same Veritas 62.</p>

<p>In the following days I prepared the carcase top and two structural shelves (the bottom and middle ones) that are fixed with ~keyed~ wedged through tenons. I glued boards, cut them to length, flattened them. On the 19th of May (around midnight) they were ready for starting joinery work.</p>

<p>Late in that night of the 19th-20th I cut the back rebate and layed out the dadoes and mortises in the sides. I used my Record 405 for the rebates. I also cut a chamfer along the height on the front internal side.</p>

<p>On the 20th (a Saturday), I cut the dovetails at the top of the carcase. I love them. I wish to cut many more dovetails in my life and live with them and offer them to my friends and family.</p>

<p>That afternoon I also cut the dadoes in the sides, with my chisel and router. I continued with cutting the through mortises for the bottom and middle shelves in the following week. That was all for the month of May. (Tbc)</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, I had smoothed and applied finish on the two sides, the top and the 2 structural shelves. I used oil from Mauler.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June I assembled and glued the carcase. I put ash wedges in the shelf  tenons (each shelf has 2 tenons on each side). I realize now that I wrote &quot;keyed tenons&quot; above, but that I should have written &quot;wedged tenons&quot;.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June I had made sure that all the shelves fitted, and I dry assembled them. I had to plane the sides to fit my dadoes.</p>

<p>On Sunday 18th I applied finish to the shelves.</p>

<p>On June 22nd during my lunch break I put finish on the back boards. These are made of fir. I did not bother planing them too much, apart from cutting shiplaps. The middle board I cut narrow, the rest comes directly from the wood pile.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June I moved the carcase up to the dining room, and started gluing up the shelves. On the first of July, I nailed the back boards using square tapered Rivierre nails (&quot;last forged nails in Europe&quot;). I put some books to try the thing, realized that some shelves missed 1 or 3 mm for some of my books to fit. I fixed the shelf to the wall using two screws going through holes in the back, behind Mort à Crédit and Les Regrets.</p>

<p>In the end I am happy and I will build a second one, and maybe a third. I will endeavour to make them appear as a single piece, maybe with moldings here and there (I want to learn how to make them). I like looking at it, and it feels solid, enough to survive me. I enjoy the simple details that I put on it, which make it mine. (The end)</p>
