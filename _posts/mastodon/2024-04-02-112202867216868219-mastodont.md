<p>The green hills of Burgundy are once again drifting through the train window, the low sun makes them bright and yellow. In the fields, zigzagging streams are satisfyingly fat. It is time to tell the story of how I built a desk for my son, at the end of 2023.</p><p>I had three projects in my head on the last day of October : a second bookcase, a door for my second son, and a desk for my his little brother. I felt that I understood beech, and I wanted to try ash. I wanted to build the worktable from Christopher Schwarz&#39;s Anarchist&#39;s Design Book. It has four big legs staked into rails. The rails fit in sliding dovetails, which was new and exciting. It also has a drawer, and I had never made one. So I made a shopping list and went to Machot.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/ebd6206157d2fb24.jpg)
<p>It was Halloween, the kids made vegetable characters and we paid a visit to this guy in Milan (best graveyard I&#39;ve seen).</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/89d6fea2d54a2248.jpg)
<p>On the next Sunday I started preparing the desk top : sawing boards, making them roughly flat on one side, and straight on one edge.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/272d1b268d02d1e2.jpg)
<p>On Tuesday night I left the top to glue for the night. Then I flattened one face (the bottom, where joinery needs geometric precision) and thicknessed the other. This ash looked stunning to me, even though its wavery grain was tougher to smooth than beech, and sometimes tore out deeply under my plane.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/52061c4770c8b157.jpg)
<p>On Sunday afternoon I looked at the big slab of ash, and eight hours later I had made one rail from it. I must have sawed  it painfully. I made the other rail on wednesday. That night I found the cat sleeping in the clean clothes on top of the washing machine.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/79423998d37400b7.jpg)
<p>I planed chamfers on the underside of the top, and plowed two dovetailed dadoes. The sides are sawn using the rails as a guide. It required a large amount of trial and error adjustment, in the form of planing the rails. My daughter made bread in the form of a butterfly (not shown but I assure you she was happy).</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/ecf1ef6d1cf52ec5.jpg)
<p>I bored the round mortises on the rails, using a sliding bevel and a construction laser as guides. Ash is hard and my cordless drill is weak for this ; like most parts of woodworking by hand this is a (welcome) lesson in patience.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/efc2822b49872188.jpg)
<p>Then I made the legs. This time I tried splitting my board instead of sawing it (I had bought an old thingy that looked appropriate to be banged with my mallet). It was a pleasure and ten minutes later I had four leg blanks. Splitting is my new favourite thing to do.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/84c1617c0b9bbfe6.jpg)
<p>I made the leg blanks parallelepipedic (am I spelling that right ?) by flattening one face, then an adjacent one at a right angle, then drawing the remaining lines and planing to them. I cut the tenons using the saw and chisel, and trying them repeatedly in one of my rails. I tapered the legs, thinner at the bottom, using my plane, and finished by making them heptagonal (that is like octogonal but you  forget one face).</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/9b5b8c41eb1a4068.jpg)
<p>It was a Friday, the first of December and with my second son we watched Die Hard 2. When the film was over, I looked through the window and snow was falling. This may be insignificant to you but we were happy.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/87db2f1a4168c106.jpg)
<p>That weekend my daughter was eleven. I glued the legs to the rails (using wedges), and the rails to the top (just a bit of glue on the front side, so that the top can expand and contract freely), and I had a table.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/0494a0ea16f180ab.jpg)
<p>Now the last thing is the drawer. While the cat watches over the neighborhood, cut the four sides of the drawer, and a fir bottom. The sides and the bottom are resawn, because otherwise they would be too thick (that means they are a board cut in two in its width). Cut half blind dovetails (a first for me, simpler than I thought). Make runners, think a bit and attach them to the top using screws.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/668eaf419abe0807.jpg)
<p>Make an igloo, smooth everything with the plane, scrapers and a bit of sandpaper, and put some Mauler oil on it. Once dry tidy the kid&#39;s bedroom and install. I am happy, this looks better than I imagined it. Fin.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/8f90c7e203be1333.jpg)
