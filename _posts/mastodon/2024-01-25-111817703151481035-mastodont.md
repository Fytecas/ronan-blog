<p>Mid-May 2022 was warm and exciting. I was dreaming and planning for my first cabinet project. There was some fir left on the floor from my workbench build and a beautiful and simple project in Schwarz&#39;s Anarchist&#39;s Design Book : a 3-legged staked drinking table. I glued together thick fir boards to make the round piece below the top, where legs are staked in. I made it round and beveled with my drawknife and plane. I drilled angled mortises for the legs.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/54b137147f94eb14.jpg)
<p>Then I made the top from an old fir board taken from my father&#39;s attic. It is round also, thinner and larger than the piece that goes below. Outside the shop in the garden under the cherry tree, the kids were setting up an above ground swimming pool.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/7ff8f7ad04e6c155.jpg)
<p>The legs are made from fir parallelepipeds. I cut them with a handsaw and a plane. Then I made them octogonal. Then I tapered them so that they are thinner at the base. I realized that making legs this way is easy and enjoyable. I remember trying to explain my work colleagues the pleasure that is the sound and feel of the plane on the wood.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/93900e24ca94a272.jpg)
<p>I glued together the top and the not-top, inserted and leveled the legs, put on 2 or 3 coats of Mauler oil and that was it. This table now sits in our bedroom, where I can work looking at the Belledonne mountains behind the curtains. To me it is a mountain table rather than a drinking one, I suppose.</p>![None]({{site.baseurl}}/media/mastodon/3f094fa50a859a2d.jpg)
